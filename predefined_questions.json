    "I feel lonely or sad or depressed or in pain. How do I deal with it?": "During difficult times, it can be hard to imagine that anyone understands our struggles. We can feel hopeless, isolated, and even forgotten by God. But there is One who truly understands. Jesus knows your pain, and He knows how to help you get through it. He lived, suffered, and died for each one of us so we’d never have to be alone.\n\nJesus came to earth so that He would know how to lift us during our trials. He’s felt our temptations, pains, sadness, and afflictions. The following scriptures teach that Jesus truly understands how we feel.\n\n'For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin' —Hebrews 4:15\n\n'And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people. And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities' —Alma 7:11–13",
    
    "What is the purpose of life?": "God has a plan for each of us. He created this earth and sent us here so we could have faith and find joy. Our challenges help us grow and prepare us to live with Him again.\n\nPossible or related questions: Why am I here? Does my life have meaning? Do the things I do really matter?\n\nGod, our loving Heavenly Father, wants us to find happiness and joy. He created a plan for us to grow, live by faith, and return to live with Him someday. His plan gives meaning and context to our life here on earth and answers the big questions: 'Where did I come from?' 'Why am I here?' and 'What happens after I die?'",
  
    "How can I be happy?": "Jesus is the way to lasting happiness. Because we all make mistakes, God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins so we can be cleansed and forgiven. When we accept Jesus and follow His example, we become less selfish and can enjoy greater love, peace, and joy.\n\nThe Bible teaches, 'For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life' (John 3:16). God sent Jesus to save us from our sins. Jesus’s teachings guide our lives and lead us to lasting happiness.",
  
    "Why do bad things happen to good people?": "How can a loving God allow His children to suffer? It’s a question that many people have wondered about. We can gain some answers by thinking about the purpose of life on earth, the role of Jesus Christ, and our eternal destiny.\n\nMoments of difficulty offer us opportunities to grow and learn. In the book of Isaiah, we read, 'Behold, I have refined thee … I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction' (Isaiah 48:10). God wants us to become the best version of ourselves. This can often be painful, but some lessons can only be learned by experience.",
  
    "How did Jesus endure His suffering?": "Jesus Christ was perfectly sinless, yet He suffered more than we can imagine. He took on all of our pains, temptations, and 'his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground' (Luke 22:44). In this unimaginable trial, the Savior even cried out, pleading with God, 'O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt' (Matthew 26:39).\n\nBut He was faithful until the end, never losing hope or giving up. He trusted in God and believed in His plan. He regularly prayed to God and asked for the strength to carry on. He knew His suffering had a purpose, and that it wouldn’t last forever. He met each challenge with faith, resilience, and patience. He set the ultimate example for each of us."
